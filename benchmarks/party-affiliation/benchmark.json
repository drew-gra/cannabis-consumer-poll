    "paragraph": "Across four waves of Cannabis Consumer Poll (CCP) data spanning May 2025 through January 2026 (combined n = 2,081), the political affiliation of cannabis consumers closely mirrors that of the general adult population in the same 31 states. Cannabis consumers identify as Republican (26.5%), Democrat (35.7%), and Other or unaffiliated (37.8%), compared to 28.6%, 33.6%, and 37.8% respectively among the general population of those states, as measured by the 2024 Cooperative Election Study. The differences — roughly two points on both the Republican and Democratic sides — fall within the pooled margin of error and are not statistically significant. Notably, the 31-state CCP footprint is only 1.5 points more Democratic than the nation as a whole, meaning geography explains very little of any surface-level differences between cannabis consumers and Americans broadly. To the extent cannabis consumers are distinctive at all in later waves, it is in a modest drift away from both major parties and toward unaffiliated status — a pattern consistent with the record-high 45% of Americans who identified as political independents nationally in 2025.",
    "caveats": [
      "CCP uses 'Other' or 'Something Else' while CES uses 'Independent/Other/Not Sure.' This may affect response distribution at the margins.",
      "CES 2024 was fielded September-November 2024. CCP waves in this benchmark span the dates listed above. Party ID is slow-moving but not static.",
      "CCP does not ask a partisan leaner follow-up, which is where most actionable political signal resides."
