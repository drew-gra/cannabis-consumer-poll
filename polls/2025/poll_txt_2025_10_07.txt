QUESTION: Last weekend, the president posted a video touting the benefits of CBD for seniors. Some have speculated that this means the administration has decided to reschedule cannabis -- which would finally acknowledge that the plant has potential medical benefit -- while others say Trump posts about a lot of issues without necessarily signaling policy action. In your opinion, what, if anything, does this news mean for the prospects of rescheduling?

RESULTS:
12% - It means rescheduling will happen
26% - It means rescheduling is more likely to happen
50% - It does not mean anything in the context of rescheduling
7% - It means rescheduling is less likely to happen
6% - It means rescheduling will not happen
