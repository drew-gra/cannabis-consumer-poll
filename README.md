## Industry Impact

Statement from Andrew Graham, head of communications at NuggMD, on the results:

Today's cannabis consumers are turning to the plant more for wellness than indulgence, a trend we consistently have been observing in our polling data.

From a public health perspective, the replacement effect cannabis use seems to have on alcohol consumption is a positive shift. Many people are substituting a potentially fatal substance with one that isn't. However, this replacement is only a safe, practical option in state-legal recreational markets. Our internal estimates show that 47% of Americans and 37% of domestic cannabis consumers still live in states without access to these markets.

Although there has been a positive shift from alcohol use to cannabis use, from a policy standpoint, federal and state prohibition is restricting the potential benefits cannabis could offer society.
